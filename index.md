The OWASP Thick Client Project is a standard awareness document for developers and security analyst. It represents the most common security risks identified in thick client applications. 

Organizations should adopt this document to ensure that their applications minimize these common risks. Using the OWASP Top 10 is perhaps the most effective first step towards changing the software development culture within your organization into one that produces more secure code.

You could/should use this project as a:
